## Special Remarks
This webpage is not a finished product. It is simply to show off the power of flex box (and pure CSS) and the role it plays in responsive design.


## To Do's
1) Add hamburger menu for header (for smaller viewports)

## What I learned
The main thing I learned from building up this webpage is how to use flex box and pure CSS to be able to create a clean (holy-grail) design.
